# Titanic_survival_prediction
## Overview:
This project involves the prediction of survival outcomes using a machine learning model. The model predicts whether an individual survived or not, based on various features, such as age, gender, and other attributes. The evaluation of the model's performance is done by comparing the predictions against actual results.
## Dataset 
This project uses a dataset that contains information about individuals, including features such as age, gender, and other attributes, to predict whether an individual survived or not.
Dataset is collected from kaggle 
## conclusion
-The project evaluates the performance of a machine learning model that predicts survival outcomes. By comparing the predicted survival outcomes with the true labels, we assess how well the model performs.
- This project serves as a demonstration of how to evaluate a machine learning model's predictions on a classification task, with a focus on survival prediction, and provides insights into model performance and evaluation.
